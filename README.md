Fragments in the twitter app

This Android demo app queries the Twitter API to give a infinite scrolling list of timeline tweets and mentions. Clicking on the Profile image and profile icon takes you to the profile with details like count of Followers and  Friends, recent tweets. 

All the required user stories are completed. UI and icons have been polished to match the official brand color #55ACEE
